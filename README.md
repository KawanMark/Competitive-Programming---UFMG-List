# UFMG Competitive Programming Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository is dedicated to storing the codes I've written for the Competitive Programming list at UFMG (Federal University of Minas Gerais).

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to keep track of my progress and solutions in competitive programming. It serves as a personal archive where I can revisit the problems and solutions, and it might also help other students who are working on the same problems.

## Contents

The repository contains:

- Solutions to problems from the UFMG Competitive Programming list.
- Each solution is stored in its own file with a name that corresponds to the problem it solves.
- The programming languages used include (but are not limited to) C++ and Python.
